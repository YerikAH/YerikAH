### Hi everyone 👋<br/>
I'm a software engineer and I'm currently building my own products. Kind of like a freelance hacker in the making, basically. If you're interested in collaborating on something, feel free to contact me anytime.

I'm also a big fan of personal development, philosophy, and values. I have a million things to improve (too many, I'd say), but that's part of the fun. Lately, I've been learning a bit about marketing, and soon I'll be diving into data science and cybersecurity.

- My stack: React • Flutter • Native React • Nest.js • Django

If you want to know more about me, check this out: [bio.link/yerikah](bio.link/yerikah)

Oh, I almost forgot: I'm working at Arxatec. I'll share more about it on my website; if you check my profile from time to time, you'll see it there.

Thanks for stopping by!
