### Hi everyone<br/>
I'm Harvey, a software engineering student aspiring to be a web developer.<br/>
I like to create cool apps, with original designs, by the way I love developing with React.<br/>
In my book times I dedicate myself to typing and reading philosophy books. <br/>
I am currently studying Back-end using PHP.
