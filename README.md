### Hi everyone <br/>
I am a software engineering and mechatronics student, as well as a language student. I am completely focused on improving my programming skills so that I can create things that help me in my day to day. Right now I'm working on an e-commerce with the MERN stack, you can see the repository by clicking here. On the other hand I am improving my programming logic with many exercises.<br/>
