### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹<br/>
I am a software engineering and mechatronics student, as well as a language student. I am completely focused on improving my programming skills so that I can create things that help me in my day to day. Right now I'm working on an e-commerce with the MERN stack, you can see the repository by [clicking here](https://github.com/YerikAH/dental-office-page). On the other hand I am improving my programming logic with many exercises.<br/>

- **Front-End Development**: React, Vue, Flutter.
- **Back-End Development**: Django, Express, Laravel.
- **Important Tools**: Git, Docker.
